    Transpile .deq files into a .deq.jit library (new pipeline).

    Reads one or more ``.deq`` files (imports inlined automatically by
    the parser), merges all definitions, and produces a ``JitLibrary``
    via :func:`deq.transpiler.jit_library_builder.build_jit_library`.
    All tags are preserved; use a separate tool to strip them if needed.

    When ``--program NAME`` is given, the named ``PROGRAM`` block is
    compiled into the library's ``program`` field by linking
    ``GadgetApplication`` wires through the gadgets' input/output ports,
    and a ``.stim`` file is emitted next to ``--out`` containing the
    concatenated bodies of the gadgets in invocation order.

    That companion ``.stim`` normally carries only the physical circuit;
    the detector (``CHECK``) and observable (``READOUT``) structure lives
    in the compiled library and is consumed by deq's own runtime decoder.
    Pass ``--detectors`` to additionally annotate the ``.stim`` with
    ``DETECTOR`` lines (including manual ``@CHECKS`` detectors) and
    ``OBSERVABLE_INCLUDE`` lines for exactly the readouts named by
    ``ASSERT_EQ`` statements, yielding a self-contained circuit for tools
    that call ``stim.Circuit.detector_error_model()``.  Only asserted
    readouts become observables: a program may emit readouts that are
    individually random (such as the intermediate Bell measurements of a
    teleportation), and exposing those would make Stim reject the circuit
    as having non-deterministic observables.

    The annotations are appended as **text**, so the existing body is
    preserved verbatim — its per-gadget header comments and any
    ``#!rhai`` directives survive.

    *jit_library* must already carry a compiled program (as produced by
    ``transpile --program``); it is compiled in memory to a ``deq.bin``
    :class:`Library` (no temporary file).  Its canonical check model gives,
    for each detector, the global measurement indices whose parity is
    deterministic noiselessly, and for each observable the indices whose
    parity gives the logical readout.  Manual ``@CHECKS("manual")`` detectors
    enter that model exactly as deq's own decoder sees them, so the exported
    Stim detectors are the same ones deq decodes against.

    Detectors are appended after the body, so a global measurement index
    ``mi`` sits at record offset ``rec[mi - num_measurements]``; the noiseless
    baseline constant is omitted, as Stim derives it on its own.

    Only the readouts named by an ``ASSERT_EQ`` statement (passed in
    *assertions* as ``(readout_index, expected_value, source)`` tuples)
    are exported as ``OBSERVABLE_INCLUDE``, one per ``ASSERT_EQ`` in
    source order (the Nth ``ASSERT_EQ`` becomes observable ``N``; repeats
    are passed through as-is, not deduped).  Each observable line is
    preceded by a ``# <source>`` comment echoing the originating
    ``ASSERT_EQ`` so the exported circuit can be traced back to the
    program.  A program can produce readouts that are individually random
    — for example the intermediate Bell-basis measurements of a logical
    teleportation, where only the final corrected readout is
    deterministic.  Exporting a random readout as a Stim observable would
    make ``stim.Circuit.detector_error_model()`` reject the circuit with a
    "non-deterministic observable" error.  By deriving observables from
    ``ASSERT_EQ`` the program author explicitly designates which readouts
    are deterministic logical observables, and takes responsibility for
    that determinism (which Stim then verifies).

    ``VIRTUAL Z1 wire``, ``VIRTUAL Y2 wire``) toggle the constant
    column of the producer gadget's ``correction_propagation`` matrix
    without consuming the wire.

    is a list of ``(readout_index, expected_bool, source)`` tuples
    derived from ``ASSERT_EQ`` statements with ``rec[-k]`` targets.

    Each gadget body lives in its own local qubit namespace anchored on
    its ``INPUT`` / ``OUTPUT`` port ``qubit_indices``. To produce a
    single self-consistent stim circuit we:

    * Track per-wire physical qubit ids in a single program-wide
      namespace. The first time a wire is produced (an ``OUTPUT``
      port), fresh physical ids are allocated for it.
    * On each gadget invocation, build a ``local → physical`` map by
      pairing each ``INPUT`` port's ``qubit_indices`` with its incoming
      wire's physical ids. If the same gadget-local qubit also appears
      in an ``OUTPUT`` port (passthrough), the physical id is reused;
      otherwise a fresh physical id is allocated.
    * Ancilla qubits — those referenced by body instructions but not
      bound to any port — get fresh physical ids per invocation.
    * Body ``Instruction``s are emitted with qubit targets remapped
      from local to physical ids. ``REPEAT`` blocks are unrolled by
      ``flatten_body``. Non-``Instruction`` body items (ports,
      READOUT/CHECK/ERROR/ASSERT) are skipped.
    * Any physical id used by the gadget that is *not* exported via
      an ``OUTPUT`` port is reset with a trailing ``R`` instruction
      so the next gadget starts from a clean state.

    A header comment per invocation prints the local→physical map.
