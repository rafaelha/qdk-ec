# Quantum Development Kit for Error Correction (QDK-EC)

Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Error Correction!

This repository is part of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk) and provides high-performance tooling for quantum error correction research and development. It includes Rust crates and Python packages for Pauli algebra, Clifford gates, stabilizer simulation, and circuit synthesis.

Implementations are based on data structures and algorithms described in [arXiv:2309.08676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08676).

## Components

This repository contains several interconnected crates:

- [binar](binar): A high-performance bit manipulation library providing bit vectors, bit matrices, and bitwise operations over GF(2).
- [paulimer](paulimer): A library for Pauli operators and Clifford gates, built on binar.
- [pauliverse](pauliverse): Fast stabilizer simulators.
- [deq](deq): A dynamic and generic QEC decoding system, including the `.deq` DSL, transpiler, JIT runtime (Rust), CLI, and an anywidget-based visualizer.
- [deqagram](deq/deqagram): A pest-based parser and typed AST for the `.deq` format (the parser behind deq).

### Python Bindings

Python bindings are available for several crates:

- [binar](binar/bindings/python): Python bindings for the binar crate.
- [paulimer](paulimer/bindings/python): Python bindings for the paulimer and pauliverse crates.
- [deqagram](deq/deqagram/bindings/python): Python bindings for the deqagram `.deq` parser.
- [deq](deq/deq) and [deq-runtime](deq/deq_runtime): pure-Python frontend and PyO3-based runtime extension.

## Building

### Prerequisites

To build this repository, you need:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable toolchain)
- [Python](https://python.org/) (3.9 or later)
- [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) (for building Python bindings)

### Building the Rust Crates

To build all crates:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Building Python Bindings

To build and install the Python bindings for development:

For binar:
```bash
cd binar/bindings/python
maturin develop --release
```

For paulimer:
```bash
cd paulimer/bindings/python
maturin develop --release
```

For deqagram:
```bash
cd deq/deqagram/bindings/python
maturin develop --release
```

## Installation

### Rust (from crates.io)

Add crates to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
binar = "0.1"
paulimer = "0.1"
pauliverse = "0.1"
```

Or use `cargo add`:

```bash
cargo add binar
cargo add paulimer
cargo add pauliverse
```

### Python (from PyPI)

```bash
pip install binar
pip install paulimer  # Includes pauliverse bindings
```

### From Source

Follow the building instructions above to install the crates and Python bindings locally.

## Quick Start

### Bit Vectors and Matrices (binar)

```rust
use binar::{BitVec, BitMatrix, Bitwise, BitwiseMut};

// Create and manipulate bit vectors
let mut v = BitVec::zeros(100);
v.assign_index(42, true);
v.assign_index(17, true);
assert_eq!(v.weight(), 2);

// Linear algebra over GF(2)
let mut matrix = BitMatrix::identity(5);
matrix.set((0, 4), true);
let pivots = matrix.echelonize();
```

### Pauli Operators and Clifford Gates (paulimer)

```rust
use paulimer::{DensePauli, SparsePauli, commutes_with};
use paulimer::{CliffordUnitary, CliffordMutable, Clifford};

// Create Pauli operators from strings
let x: DensePauli = "XII".parse().unwrap();  // X ⊗ I ⊗ I
let z: SparsePauli = "Z0".parse().unwrap();  // Sparse: Z₀

// Check commutation (X and Z anticommute)
assert!(!commutes_with(&x, &z));

// Build Clifford gates and propagate Paulis
let mut clifford = CliffordUnitary::identity(2);
clifford.left_mul_cx(0, 1);  // Apply CNOT: X₀ → X₀ ⊗ X₁

let x0: DensePauli = "XI".parse().unwrap();
let image = clifford.image(&x0);
assert_eq!(image, "XX".parse::<DensePauli>().unwrap());
```

## Benchmarks

This repository uses [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) for Rust benchmarks and [ASV](https://asv.readthedocs.io/) for Python benchmarks.

To run Rust benchmarks:

```bash
cargo bench
```
